# My Pet Planner

# Description:

Pet log will be a full crud application where you can log and track the growth of your pet. As someone who has a 6 month old puppy, I would like to be able to have something where I can see how he has grown in size, weight, eating schedules, vet visits, grooming appointments, or whatever else you would like to log.
